## Introduction

To make sure that my application is running as intended, I will be using different tools to see its perfomance.

- I will put my intro page and quiz page through lighthouse for PC and Mobile.
- I will check the HTML code through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- I will check the CSS code through [W3C Validator - Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- I will check the Javascript code through [JShint](https://jshint.com/)
